## This is a dummy file
##
## Run `ARandR` application and adjust your screen layout there.
## Once done, Click on SAVE Icon or go to 'Layout > Save As' to save your screen layout.
## To restore your screen layout on login, Edit your window manager's startup script and add your saved script there.
##
## Ex: in openbox, edit '~/.config/openbox/autostart' script and add the following lines at the end of the file:
##		sleep 2
##		~/.screenlayout/my-layout.sh
##
## This will execute the '~/.screenlayout/my-layout.sh' script on openbox startup and your screen/monitor layout will be restored.
##
## You can save as many layouts as you want, and same way you can restore them on startup.
